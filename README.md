# leaflet-challenge

Create a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquake from the dataset 

### Get Data 

Use the url to pull in the data for the visualization
(https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php)


### Import & Visualize the Data

Create a map using Leaflet and plot the data based on the longitude and latitude.

    * Reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and depth of the earth by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger and earthquakes with greater depth should appear darker in color.

    * Include popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.

    * Create a legend that will provide context for your map data.
